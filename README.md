# GTestXMLtoGSheets
Automated Testing Documentation </br>
Use Google Test to test your C/C++ code, and then run this python script to convert ugly XML into Google Sheets testing documentation.</br>
- first set up a Google Developer account</br>
- Make a new project</br>
- Create a Service account, and get your Google Sheets API credentials in .json form (I simply renamed the .json file "creds")</br>
- Set up your Google Sheet</br>
- Share your google sheets with the service account </br>
- Drop that credential .json into the same file as this </br>
- Route all your GTest XML results to your "XML_Logs" folder</br>
- Automate the rest of your testing documentation </br>
